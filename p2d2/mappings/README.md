# Mappings

This optimizer uses an IR between procedural data manipulation libraries and declarative data access languages. In order to map from a procedural data manipulation library, one needs to create a __frontend__ mapping. In order to map to a declarative data access language, one creates a __backend__ mapping. The respective documentation on how to write frontend or backend mappings is located in the respective folders.
